## Contribute a plugin or improve documentation

The following repositories are the sources of all plugins represented in this plugin gallery:

* [Munin (master)](https://github.com/munin-monitoring/munin/tree/master)
* [Munin (stable-2.0)](https://github.com/munin-monitoring/munin/tree/stable-2.0)

You are encouraged to propose a pull request via github or send a patch via IRC (`#munin` at
`irc.oftc.net`) or to the [user mailinglist](mailto:munin-users@lists.sourceforge.net).

Your contribution is very welcome!


## Improve the plugin gallery

The plugin gallery is generated by a small python script combined with a base template for
[hugo](https://gohugo.io/) (a static site generator).

The [munin-plugin-gallery repository](https://github.com/munin-monitoring/munin-plugin-gallery)
contains all relevant files.

Take a look at [plugin-gallery-generator](https://github.com/munin-monitoring/munin-plugin-gallery/blob/master/plugin-gallery-generator)
for the plugin documentation parser and [hugo-base](https://github.com/munin-monitoring/munin-plugin-gallery/tree/master/hugo-base)
for the hugo base template.

Suggestions for other sources of plugins (not maintained by the
[Munin team on github](https://github.com/munin-monitoring)) are also welcome.
